### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, function, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

In example.rb, the AreaCalculator class needs to be modified to handle new shapes.

In refactor.rb, each shape class is responsible for calculating its own area, so AreaCalculator doesnâ€™t need to be modified for new shapes.
